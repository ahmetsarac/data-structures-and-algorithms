# Algorithms

## What is an algorithm?
In computer scince, algorithm is a series of instructions to solve a problem or to make something to a computer step by step. It's kind of a way of doing something. However, algorithms are not just for computers. We can use algorithms anywhere we like. Let me show it with an example.

### Example
We can thinks algorithms as a recipe which can contains the steps of making a meal or a drink.

Let's create an algorithm for making potato fries.

1. Get the potatoes.
2. Peel the potatoes.
3. Slice the potatoes.
4. Get the pot.
5. Fill the pot with oil.
6. Put the pot on the cooker.
7. Turn on the cooker.
8. Wait 5 minutes.
9. If the oil is hot enough go to step 11 if not wait 2 more minutes
10. Put the potatoes in the pot.
11. Wait 15 minutes.
12. Take the potates from the pot to the plate.
13. Serve.

This is a good example for an algorithm that can be used as a recipe. The recipe constists of the steps that you perform one after another. In general we can think the algorithm is the recipe for computers. 

## Pseudocode
You can see a word called "pseudocode" while you are working with algorithms. Pseudocode is like that we did on above but it's for computers.

### Pseudocode example
Let's write a pseudocode that calculates the area of a rectangle.

1. BEGIN
2. NUMBER b1, b2, area
3. INPUT B1
4. INPUT B2
5. area = b1 * b2
6. OUTPUT area
7. END

We are using the pseudocodes to describe algorithms language independent. Sometimes it differs to person to person because there are no strict rules while writing a pseudocode. The main key is understanding the algorithm.

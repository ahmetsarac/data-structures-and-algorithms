# Data Structures

## What is a data structure?
A data structure is a way to organize datas and manage them in easy way by using relationships, functions and operations.

## Why do we need the data structures?
When we are working with a lot of data we can create data structures to ease our job. We can bundle the relevant datas in the same structure
and we can manage them easily. Moreover, using data structures makes our codebase cleaner, easy to read and understand.

## What is abstract data type?
Abstract data type(ADT) is an abstraction model for data types. It defines an interface, and behaviours about data structures but not giving a definition about their implementations.

## What is the difference between an abstract data type and a data structure?
As I mentioned above abstract data types defines an interface not implementations but the data structures contains that implementations.

| Abstract Data Type | Data Structure                                                     |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lists              | Dynamic Array<br>Linked Lists                                      |
| Queues             | Linked Lists based Queue<br>Array based Queue<br>Stack based Queue |
| Map                | Tree Map<br>Hash Map                                               |
| Vehicle            | Golf Cart<br>Bicycle<br>Smart Car                                  |
